# Magic and Mayhem
A simple card based TTRPG; print-at-home and modify as needed. Please reach out to me with questions or forks!

# Mission:
This is a simple tabletop dungeon crawler that prioritizes cooperation and creative problem solving. Accessible to both kids and adults and can be completed in under an hour or last longer depending on the choice of setup. Made to be expandable.
Gameplay is rapid, entertaining and hilarious with surprises, group challenges and instant gratification (ie:) Does not require advanced knowledge or tons of reading or looking things up. Does not need a DM or more than 1 6-sided die. Uses counters instead of writing for stat & HP changes. Complexity comes from logical, simple combinations of players' stats and abilities.

# Setup
Print Magic-and-mayhem-cards.pdf, double-sided, preferably on card stock. Cut each page into 4 1/4 sheet cards. 3D Print files in stl-figurines and str-tokens folders. choose colors that make sense to you for example: red for life tokens, black for death tokens, purple for monsters etc..

Read through Rules_ Magic and Mayhem.pdf LMK if you have questions or things are unclear - I'll revise and repost!
